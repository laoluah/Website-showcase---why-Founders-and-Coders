# Website-showcase---why-Founders-and-Coders


My webpage is combining my passions for tech and acting (specifically voice acting)

On my webpage it takes you through 6 voiceover demos I've made, and how they relate to how I feel that Founders and Coders would be a great opportunity for me to continue to develop, learn from peers as well as add to the group, coming from a legal/acting background, which may be unusual, but there are parallels to coding.
